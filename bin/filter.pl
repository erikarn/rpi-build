# This is a simple filter for the metalog stuff from FreeBSD's
# install target.

# When doing a user-only build, g"make installworld/make installkernel"
# will populate METALOG in the DESTDIR of your build.  That will contain
# the files/devices/directories/etc from the above make targets with their
# eventual ownership/mode and such.
#
# However, if one wishes to customise things after that build, you'll
# likely want to modify / append to METALOG.
#
# So, to make this a little easier, this is a very simple filter that
# will take a file to add things to (and only add for now!) and it'll
# append/replace entries in the original METALOG.
#
# Ie, if the original metalog has:
#
# ./a
# ./b
#
# And you wish to modify './b' (say, it has a new file size) and add './c',
# then we need to both replace the './b' entry with the new one and append
# any entries that we haven't replaced.
#
# (I'm not really sure why this hasn't come up before as part of all of
# this nonsense, but whatever.)
