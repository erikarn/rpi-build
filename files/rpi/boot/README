Overview of Raspberry PI boot Sequence for FreeBSD

There is an initial "Phase One" that is the same regardless
of what OS you are booting.  The following "Phase Two" varies
considerably.


PHASE ONE: Initialize the hardware
==================================

This first boot phase is common to any use of RaspberryPi, whether
you're booting Linux, FreeBSD, or any other software.  It loads a
series of proprietary boot loader files that initialize the
hardware and ultimately load and run some executable.

These initial bits are loaded from the first partition on the SD card.
That partition must be formatted as FAT16 or FAT32.

* At power on, the ARM core is off and the GPU is on.  SDRAM is disabled.

* GPU ROM code reads bootcode.bin from SD card and executes it on the GPU.

* bootcode.bin enables SDRAM and loads start.elf

  (Note:  bootcode.bin used to execute loader.bin and loader.bin then
  loaded start.elf.  This is no longer true since Oct 2012; loader.bin
  is gone and bootcode.bin now loads start.elf directly.)

  (If gpu_mem is set very low, then bootcode.bin reads start_cd.elf
  instead.  This is a stripped-down version which lacks the
  video support; suitable for systems that run purely with serial
  console.)

  (Q: Does bootcode.bin read config.txt?  Seems like it
  must if it loads start_cd.elf depending on the memory config.)

* bootcode.bin executes start.elf on the GPU (start.elf is
  the "GPU firmware" that remains resident.)

* start.elf reads config.txt and uses it to configure the hardware.

* Optional: start.elf loads an FDT machine description into memory
  at a fixed address.

* Optional: start.elf reads cmdline.txt with arguments for kernel.img

The next part depends on what OS you are loading.  In any
case, start.elf remains in place on the GPU.  Video drivers
in the OS talk to start.elf (they don't communicate directly
with the GPU).

Note:  The most recent boot files are available from
github.com/raspberrypi/firmware  (Warning:  git clone
of this project is very time-consuming!)


PHASE TWO for LINUX:
====================

If you're booting Linux, start.elf loads a file called
kernel.img containing the Linux kernel.


PHASE TWO for "bare-metal" programming:
=======================================

There are some examples of bare-metal RaspberryPi programming
at github.com/dwelch67/raspberrypi.

These use the same boot process as for Linux, but replace
kernel.img with simple freestanding executables.


PHASE TWO for FreeBSD with U-Boot and ubldr:
============================================

The config.txt file specifies "kernel=u-boot.bin", so
start.elf loads the u-boot.bin file:

* u-boot loads and initializes

* U-Boot loads either uEnv.txt or uBoot.scr to configure
  itself.  Among other things, these files should tell
  U-Boot where the FDT file is located in memory.

* u-boot loads ubldr from the FAT partition.
  ubldr is a version of the FreeBSD standard loader(8) which
  uses the u-boot API to access the hardware.

* ubldr initializes, finds U-Boot in memory so it
  can use U-Boot API for hardware access

* ubldr gets the FDT address from U-Boot

* ubldr locates a UFS partition on the SD card.

* ubldr loads /boot/loader.rc from the UFS partition and
  uses it to set up some boot-time parameters.

* ubldr loads the FreeBSD kernel from UFS

* ubldr attaches the FDT to the kernel so the
  the kernel will find it.

* The FreeBSD kernel initializes and runs.



PHASE TWO for FreeBSD without ubldr:
====================================

It should be possible to load the FreeBSD kernel directly from U-Boot
or even directly from start.elf.  This might require teaching the
FreeBSD kernel how to more fully utilize the Linux-format boot
information provided by U-Boot.

Pro: Potentially faster booting by eliminating the U-Boot and
ubldr phases.

Con: U-Boot and ubldr support debugging and configuring
the early kernel initialization.  Booting without those would
reduce some of the customizability.

Con: Requires kernel to live on the MSDOS partition.  (There
may be ways to make this less awkward.)

For now, being able to debug and configure the early
boot stages is very valuable, but as FreeBSD gets
more stable this may change.
